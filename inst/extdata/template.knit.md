## Reason for Referral

<!-- Information to Include in Reason for Referral Section
• List name and position of referral source
• Reason the individual is to be evaluated—What questions are to be addressed?
• Concerns of parent, caregiver, teacher, or examinee (if applicable)
• Previous diagnoses, disabilities, or medical concerns -->

{{< var first_name >}} {{< var last_name >}} is a {{< var age >}}-year-old, {{< var handedness >}}right-handed research assistant with {{< var education >}} years of education, including a B.A. in Hustling from the University of Biggie. {{< var he_she_cap >}} was referred in order to determine the nature and extent of neurocognitive sequelae emerging from a history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

The purpose of the current evaluation is {{< var dx1 >}}, {{< var dx2 >}}, and {{< var dx3 >}}. This report is based on a review of available medical records and information gathered across multiple days of evaluation. Treatment planning and plans for test accommodations were discussed with {{< var first_name >}} during the feedback visit on the final day of the examination.

## Background

<!-- **Information to Include in Background Information Section**
Provide pertinent information that has been obtained from all sources, including the referral source, family members, examinee, teachers, medical records, and so on. Do not include needless details or gossip. Following are examples of information that should be included:
• Current family dynamics (spouse, children, siblings, etc.)
• Medical and psychiatric history
• Developmental history
• Educational history (note any special services)
• Employment history (for adults)
• Previous therapeutic intervention
• Current stressors
• Summary of past evaluations -->


The following information was obtained during an interview with {{< var patient >}} and from review of available medical records. {{< var first_name >}} has been doing well in {{< var his_her >}} classes since starting law school and has never failed. However, issues have begun to arise that {{< var he_she >}} has been unable to avoid, including being easily distracted, restlessness, constantly fidgeting, procrastination, and variable attention. {{< var he_she_cap >}} suspects having ADHD and has always struggled with aspects of it. {{< var first_name >}}'s mother tried to get {{< var his_her >}} evaluated and tested when {{< var he_she >}} was younger, but was never able to do so because {{< var his_her >}} school at the time did not agree that there were major concerns. {{< var he_she_cap >}} has noticed increasing difficulty initiating tasks, especially when it comes to writing long research papers, and has been procrastinating more and more. {{< var first_name >}} has read up on ADHD and believes {{< var he_she >}} may have it, but has been able to hide it from others, as {{< var he_she >}} has "gotten good at pretending to pay attention." {{< var he_she_cap >}} seeks further assessment and evaluation to identify any underlying neurocognitive factors influencing {{< var his_her >}} academic motivations and performance.

**Cognitive complaints**: sustained attention, working memory, and organization.

## Overall Evaluation Interpretation

Neuropsychological evaluation revealed a pattern of cognitive strengths and weaknesses characterized by below-average overall neuropsychological functioning. Notable strengths emerged in visuoperceptual processing and visuoconstructional abilities, where performance reached the high average range for focused spatial tasks. The patient demonstrated average capabilities in basic judgment, decision-making, and orientation to person, place, time, and situation.

## Diagnostic Impression

- 294.11 (F02.81) Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, Moderate, With behavioral disturbance: 8A68.4 Generalized tonic-clonic seizure
- V61.10 (Z63.0) Relational Problems


```{=typst}
= RECOMMENDATIONS
```

There are several support systems and community resources that could be helpful for Mr. Smalls as he copes with the emotional and psychological impact of the accident:

1. Grief counseling or support groups: Reaching out to grief counselors or joining a support group for individuals who have experienced traumatic loss could provide a safe space for Mr. Smalls to process his feelings of guilt, shame, and grief.

2. Trauma-informed therapy: Finding a therapist who specializes in trauma-informed care can help Mr. Smalls work through the PTSD-like symptoms he may be experiencing, such as flashbacks, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping.

3. Religious or spiritual community: Connecting with his Jewish community, whether through a synagogue or other religious organizations, can provide Mr. Smalls with a sense of belonging and support during this difficult time.

4. Victim support services: There may be local organizations or programs that offer resources and assistance to victims of accidents and their families. Mr. Smalls's attorney or local authorities may be able to connect him with these services.

5. Peer support groups: Joining a support group specifically for individuals who have been involved in accidental deaths or serious injuries could help Mr. Smalls feel less alone and provide a space to share his experiences.

6. Wellness activities: Engaging in activities that promote self-care, such as meditation, yoga, or art therapy, can help Mr. Smalls manage stress and find moments of peace.

The key is for Mr. Smalls not to try to navigate this alone. Seeking out professional support and connecting with a community of understanding individuals can be invaluable as he works through the emotional and psychological challenges he's facing.

## Test Selection Procedures

Neuropsychological tests are performance-based, and cognitive performance is summarized above. Cultural considerations were made in selecting measures, interpreting results, and making diagnostic impressions and recommendations. Test scores are reported in comparison to same-age and sex/gender peers, with labels (e.g., Below Average, Average, Above Average; [@guilmetteAmericanAcademyClinical2020]), intended to be descriptive, not diagnostic. Standardized scores provide important context, but do not alone lead to accurate diagnosis or treatment recommendations.

## Conversion of Test Scores
