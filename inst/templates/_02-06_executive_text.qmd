A measure of both attentional capacity and working memory fell within the Average.
The patient's ability to encode, maintain, and recall visual information in short-term working memory fell within the Average and ranked at the 63th percentile, indicating performance as good as or better than 63% of same-age peers from the general population.
Processing Speed (*G*s) was Average.
Orientation to person, place, time, and situation was intact.
Auditory attentional capacity was Average (7 digits forward).
Working memory for orally presented information was Average (5 digits backward).
Self-monitoring and perseverative tendencies was Average.

Selective visual attention, visual discrimination, and visual-perceptual processing was Average.
The patient's ability to encode, maintain, and recall visual information in short-term working memory fell within the Average and ranked at the 50th percentile, indicating performance as good as or better than 50% of same-age peers from the general population.
Auditory attentional capacity, or how much information can be processed at once fell within the Average.
A marker of reduced focus, or selective attention, distractibility, or reduced concentration, and diminished sustained attention fell within the Average.
Visual search speed, scanning, speed of processing, and motor speed and coordination on Part A of the Trail Making Test fell within the Average range.
Total number of intrusive response errors was Average.
Elias's score on Coding (speed of information processing) was Average.
Visual-perceptual decision-making speed fell within the Average and ranked at the 25th percentile, indicating performance as good as or better than 25% of same-age peers from the general population.

Efficiency of psychomotor speed, visual scanning ability, and visual-motor coordination fell within the Low Average and ranked at the 16th percentile, indicating performance as good as or better than 16% of same-age peers from the general population.
`r params$first_name`'s performance on a complex measure of divided attention, information processing speed, and inhibition was Below Average.
Leo's Statue score of  0 () is classified as Below Average and is ranked at the  4th percentile, indicating performance as good as or better than  4% of same age peers from the general population. This estimate of Motor persistence and inhibition is considered a relative neurocognitive weakness and moderate concern.
